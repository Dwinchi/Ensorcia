				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<p>In a land far far away, called Ensorcia, there are many people who live in peace with magic, and powers. Their magic and powers are their source of life; it is called Entix, and comes from a mother crystal placed in the center of two kingdoms, though it also comes from an unknown source. The two Kingdoms: Sovereign, Kingdom of Light of Life, and Unholy, The Kingdom of Darkness and Death, have lived in peace for many years, though it was not always like that. For many centuries, the Sovereign and Unholy kingdoms were at war, taking the magic and powers from each other's kingdoms and soldiers, but also searching for a hidden and legendary kingdom. The kingdom of the sea people: Altariux. Their motives were different, but very much the same. The Unholy Kingdom wanting to take the riches and powerful magic which is spoken of in the legend, and the Sovereign wanting to become Allies with the sea people to become an evermore powerful kingdom. Up until 50 years ago, when a new Queen was crowned in the Sovereign Kingdom, was the war ended. The war was ended after centuries because the Queen saw that the endless war was futile; many soldiers would lose their lives, wives left widowed and children left to starve for a kingdom that most likely does not exist. The King of the Unholy Kingdom signed an agreement with the Sovereign Kingdom to end the war, but by no means are they allies. Even with the war over, the two Kingdoms have a strong hatred for each other, in Politics and as citizens. The Kingdoms are placed on opposite sides of Ensorcia, being 3 days apart from each other by horse, and a week by foot, though travelling from Kingdom to another is a suicide mission. The Sovereign Kingdom basks in light, with the sun shining brightly on the kingdom, whereas the Unholy Kingdom stays in the cold shadows, living in constant midnight.</p>
				<p>After leaving each Kingdom, they are met with high security: with guards and a magical force field surrounding each kingdom 10,000 meters out, and once they are out of the force field, they are met with lands of plains, deserts, bogs, though one thing remains the same throughout all biomes: there is a deathly fog with surrounds the lands, and predators who roam around. The land outside the Kingdoms is called "No mans Land" or "Dead mans Land." as many who leave their kingdoms and enter No man's land, never return. A vast ocean part of Dead man's land surrounding Ensorcia, it is called the Sea of Unreturning and is rumoured to home the Kingdom of Altariux. Dead man's Land, and the Sea of Unreturning have both been battlefields for all 800 years of the Unforgiving War, and many travelers leave without returning. Rumor is: the lost and trapped souls of the fallen soldiers roam around the lands taking lives of travelers, wanting a second chance at life, or are simply just angry and seek revenge on the species which took their lives.The year is now 1165, both kingdoms live in quiet hatred for each other, living in peace trying to coexist with each other. Though the Legend of Altariux is now seen as a fairytale, or a child's story, many still venture out to find the hidden Kingdom, in hopes to find treasure, or live in luxury.</p>
				<p>All who have left have never returned, and many who dream of going to Altariux are seen as "Insane" and Suicidal. Many parents even use Altariux as a threat against their children who are disobedient, telling them they will send them there, or some joke about wanting to go to Altariux, or will bring their friend to Altariux as some form of a joke of death, but will never speak of the dead or utter the words unless mourning. It seems as if every day, the unstable peace of both Kingdoms grows ever more unsteady, with more people venturing out and wanting power, it will only be a matter of time before a corrupt king sits upon the throne. Though.. There is more to this world than just these two kingdoms, seek and you shall find, perhaps there is a counsel in the skies, which shall guide you through your life.</p>

				<p>{What will you do? What side will you choose? Do you wish to see Altariux, too?}</p>
